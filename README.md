# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as the foundational blueprint for the **FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint** project. Its primary purpose is to document, analyze, and structure the requirements for a booking management system, simulating a real-world software development scenario.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting what a software system needs to do before development begins.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Saves money** - Fixing errors early is cheaper
- **Clear direction** - Developers know what to build
- **Prevents scope creep** - Defines project boundaries
- **Quality assurance** - Ensures right product is built
- **Risk reduction** - Identifies problems early

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and meetings
  - Reviewing existing documentation and business processes
  - Identifying project goals, objectives, and constraints

- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Extracting detailed requirements using techniques like brainstorming and prototyping
  - Asking probing questions to uncover hidden or implicit needs
  - Engaging with end-users to understand their daily workflows and pain points

- **Requirement Documentation**
  - Creating Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents
  - Writing clear and unambiguous functional and non-functional requirements
  - Using visual aids like use case diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Analyzing requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility
  - Prioritizing requirements based on business value and technical constraints
  - Creating models to visualize system behavior and data flow

- **Requirement Validation**
  - Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy
  - Conducting walkthroughs and inspections to identify gaps
  - Getting formal sign-off to confirm requirements are correctly understood
