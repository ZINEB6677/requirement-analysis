# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as the foundational blueprint for the **FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint** project. Its primary purpose is to document, analyze, and structure the requirements for a booking management system, simulating a real-world software development scenario.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting what a software system needs to do before development begins.

## Key Activities:
- Gather requirements from stakeholders
- Categorize requirements (functional vs non-functional)
- Analyze for completeness and feasibility
- Document in Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
- Validate with stakeholders

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Saves money** - Fixing errors early is cheaper
- **Clear direction** - Developers know what to build
- **Prevents scope creep** - Defines project boundaries
- **Quality assurance** - Ensures right product is built
- **Risk reduction** - Identifies problems early

Without proper requirement analysis, projects risk failure, budget overruns, and missed deadlines.
